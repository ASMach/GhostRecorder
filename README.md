 GhostRecorder
A replay system that records and replays GameObject's movements and rotation.

## Video

You can see GhostRecorder in action here: https://youtu.be/AD2W5EXex5Q

## WebGL Demo

You can also play around with in in a WebGL Demo: [COMING SOON]

## Instructions
Simply drag and drop a GameObject that you wish to record inside of "Recorder" GameObject and a Ghost GameObject (which will miminc the original GameObject during the replay).scs

## Variables
You can set how often to take "snapshots" of GameObject's state by tweaking the SnapshotFrequency. Please note that the lower it gets the more increase memory usage it will have.

You can also set for how long to record the GameObject, although you can end the recording prematurely. Note that changing the "Max Record Time" will increase the memory usage.
